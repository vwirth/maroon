# üå∞ MAROON Documentation

This is the official code repository accompanying the paper [MAROON]().  
It includes a python-based dataset viewer and provides data preprocessing code for all sensor measurements of:
* Microsoft Kinect Azure
* Intel Realsense D435i
* Stereolabs Zed X Mini
* Rohde & Schwarz's QAR50 radar submodule
* Groundtruth Multi View Stereo reconstructions with Agisoft Metashape

Furthermore, it includes the reconstruction code for the MIMO imaging radar measurements.

## Dependencies

This repository adapts code from Ibai Gorordo's [pyKinectAzure](https://github.com/ibaiGorordo/pyKinectAzure), which is located in `external/pykinect_azure`. To install this package, run:
```
cd external/pykinect_azure;
python -m pip install setup.py 
```
All other dependencies are listed in `maroon/setup.py`. To install the `maroon` package, run:
```
cd code/maroon;
python3 -m pip install setup.py 
```

## Configuration
Configure your location of the MAROON dataset in the configuration file in `configs/script_config.json`.
A short explanation of all important configuration settings is provided here:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `base_path` | The base path where the dataset lies, e.g. `<your-path-to>/maroon` |
| `reconstruction_path` | If you enabled `use_relative_paths`, the object directory name that you want to visualize suffices, e.g. `02_cardboard_30` |
| `use_empty_space_measurements` | MAROON provides additional radar measurements of the empty space of the setup, where no object was placed in front of the sensor. This measurement helps to filter out noise artifacts that arise from external sources that were present in the measurement room. |
| `mask_erosion` | The kernel size of the KxK mask erosion kernel that is applied during the computation of the error metrics |
| `radar:force_redo` | By default, the radar dataset loader uses the cached reconstructions within the dataset to load the respective reconstruction volume (`volume`), pointcloud (`xyz`), depth map (`depth`), or amplitude map (`maxproj`). If you explicitely want to trigger the reconstruction algorithms, set this flag to true. |
| `radar:use_intrinsic_parameters` | Once a radar reconstruction is done, the hyperparameters are stored in an intrinsic file. These parameters are used to load the cached reconstruction files and - in case the `radar:reconstruction_reco_params` have changed - to check whether reconstruction has to be redone. |
| `radar:amplitude_filter_threshold_dB` | the decibel threshold to filter out background noise and sidelobes such that only valid radar depth values remain. |
| `radar:reconstruction_capture_params` | The voxel extents as well as the voxel density that are used for the radar reconstruction. |
| `calibration_filename` | the name of the calibration file that is used to align the different sensor coordinate systems. |


## Execution
The code uses `pycuda` to accelerate some portions of code operating on large-scale data. The respective `*.cu` files are located in `maroon/cuda`. To save time at runtime (and disable the JIT compilter of `pycuda`) you can precompile the cuda files beforehand:
```
cd maroon/cuda;
./precompile.sh # make sure to adjust the GPU architecture to your hardware first
```

The live viewer can be executed with:
```
cd code;
python main.py
```
